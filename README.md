## Step 1 Fork:

Make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account before you do anything else.
Make sure you are logged into your GitHub account then click the fork button on this page.

## Step 2 Install and Run:

Once your on the fork page click ***Code*** -> ***Codespaces*** -> ***Create Codespace on Main***.
This should open the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) web editor.
Once the web editor is opened there should be a terminal at the bottem.
Click on the terminal and type in "***cd nodeunblocker.com***" for nodeunblocker (Recommended) and "***cd Riptide***" for Riptide.
After that run "***npm i***" to install the dependencies.
Now you can finally run "***npm start***" to run the program.
After a couple of seconds there should be a popup about port forwarding; click the blue button in that popup.
